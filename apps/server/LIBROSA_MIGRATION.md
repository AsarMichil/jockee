# Migration from Spotify Audio Features API to Librosa

## Overview

This document describes the migration from Spotify's deprecated audio features API to a librosa-based audio analysis system. This change ensures the application continues to function after Spotify's API deprecation while providing more control over the audio analysis process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Audio Analysis Service (`app/services/audio_analysis.py`)

- **Updated analysis version**: Changed from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`
- **Added comprehensive feature extraction**: Now extracts all audio features using librosa:
  - `danceability`: Based on rhythm regularity and beat strength
  - `valence`: Musical positivity based on harmonic and timbral features
  - `acousticness`: Spectral characteristics indicating acoustic vs electric instruments
  - `instrumentalness`: Vocal detection to determine instrumental content
  - `liveness`: Audience detection and reverb analysis
  - `speechiness`: Speech pattern detection
  - `loudness`: RMS energy converted to dB scale
  - `bpm`: Tempo detection using beat tracking
  - `key`: Musical key detection using chroma features
  - `energy`: RMS energy and spectral characteristics

### 2. Removed Spotify Audio Features API (`app/core/spotify.py`)

- **Removed `get_audio_features` method**: No longer calls Spotify's deprecated API
- **Maintained other Spotify functionality**: Playlist and track metadata fetching still works

### 3. Updated Analysis Tasks (`app/workers/analysis_tasks.py`)

- **Removed Spotify audio features integration**: No longer fetches or processes Spotify audio features
- **Enhanced librosa integration**: All audio features now come from librosa analysis
- **Updated track processing**: Handles all new audio features from librosa

### 4. Updated Track Model (`app/models/track.py`)

- **Updated default analysis version**: Changed to `2.0.0` to reflect librosa-only analysis

### 5. Fixed Audio Fetcher (`app/services/audio_fetcher.py`)

- **Improved yt-dlp configuration**: Fixed format selection and post-processing
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced debugging and file verification
- **Optimized download process**: Proper audio extraction and conversion

## Technical Details

### Audio Feature Extraction Methods

Each audio feature is extracted using specific librosa functions and algorithms:

- **BPM**: `librosa.beat.beat_track()` with onset strength analysis
- **Key**: Chroma features with major/minor pattern matching
- **Energy**: RMS energy with spectral characteristics
- **Danceability**: Beat consistency and rhythm regularity
- **Valence**: Harmonic analysis (major vs minor) + spectral brightness + tempo
- **Acousticness**: Spectral centroid, bandwidth, and zero-crossing rate
- **Instrumentalness**: Vocal frequency range detection
- **Liveness**: Dynamic range and spectral variation analysis
- **Speechiness**: Speech frequency range and rhythm patterns
- **Loudness**: RMS energy converted to dB scale

### Compatibility Calculation

The system maintains compatibility scoring between tracks using:
- **BPM compatibility**: Tracks within 6% BPM difference are considered compatible
- **Key compatibility**: Harmonic mixing rules based on circle of fifths
- **Energy compatibility**: Similar energy levels for smooth transitions

## Testing

### Test Script

A comprehensive test script is available: `test_librosa_analysis.py`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test with automatic file detection
python test_librosa_analysis.py

# Test with specific file
python test_librosa_analysis.py path/to/audio/file.mp3

# Test only compatibility calculation
python test_librosa_analysis.py --compatibility-only
```

**Features:**
- Tests all audio feature extraction
- Verifies compatibility calculation
- Provides detailed analysis output
- Supports command-line arguments
- Automatic file discovery

### Verification

To verify the migration is working:

1. **Run the test script**: `python test_librosa_analysis.py`
2. **Check analysis results**: Ensure all features are extracted (not None)
3. **Verify compatibility**: Test track compatibility calculation
4. **Monitor logs**: Check for any analysis errors in application logs

## Performance Considerations

- **Analysis time**: Librosa analysis takes 10-30 seconds per track (depending on length)
- **CPU usage**: More CPU-intensive than API calls but provides better control
- **Memory usage**: Moderate memory usage for audio processing
- **Accuracy**: Feature extraction accuracy depends on audio quality and content

## Migration Benefits

1. **Independence**: No longer dependent on Spotify's deprecated API
2. **Control**: Full control over feature extraction algorithms
3. **Customization**: Can adjust feature extraction parameters as needed
4. **Reliability**: No API rate limits or external service dependencies
5. **Consistency**: Same analysis results regardless of external API changes

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the librosa-based system:

1. **Advanced key detection**: Implement more sophisticated key detection algorithms
2. **Genre classification**: Add genre detection using machine learning
3. **Mood analysis**: Enhanced valence calculation with mood classification
4. **Beat grid detection**: Precise beat grid for better DJ mixing
5. **Harmonic analysis**: Advanced harmonic content analysis
6. **Performance optimization**: Parallel processing for batch analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Analysis fails**: Check if audio file exists and is readable
2. **Missing features**: Verify librosa installation and dependencies
3. **Slow analysis**: Normal for high-quality audio files
4. **Memory errors**: Reduce audio quality or process shorter segments

### Dependencies

Ensure these packages are installed:
- `librosa >= 0.10.0`
- `numpy`
- `soundfile`
- `scipy`

### Logs

Check application logs for analysis errors:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "audio_analysis"
```

## Conclusion

The migration from Spotify's audio features API to librosa has been successfully completed. The system now provides:

- ✅ All original audio features (danceability, valence, etc.)
- ✅ Enhanced feature extraction control
- ✅ Independence from external APIs
- ✅ Comprehensive testing framework
- ✅ Detailed documentation

The application continues to function as before, but with improved reliability and control over the audio analysis process.
